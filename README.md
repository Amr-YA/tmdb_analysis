before starting the analysis, some issues were found in the data and treated through various solutions:
- A lot redundant columns, 20 columns are too much to explore
- some rows are duplicated
- Some values are not logical like runtime = 0, revenue and budget = $0
- Some columns have multiple values in one cell, like genre

Then using visuals and graphs, some questions about movies revenue were explored:
- If there's correlation between vote, budget, and revenue
- What's Impact of voting score on revenue
- The ranking of genres' revenue in last year
Some extra questions about each genre releases numbers
